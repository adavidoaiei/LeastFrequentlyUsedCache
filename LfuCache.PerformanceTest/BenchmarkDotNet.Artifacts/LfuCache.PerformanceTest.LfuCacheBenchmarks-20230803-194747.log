//    * Assembly LfuCache.PerformanceTest which defines benchmarks references non-optimized LFUCache
	If you own this dependency, please, build it in RELEASE.
	If you don't, you can disable this policy by using 'config.WithOptions(ConfigOptions.DisableOptimizationsValidator)'.

//    * Assembly LfuCache.PerformanceTest which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
